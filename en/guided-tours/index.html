								<h3>My offer</h3>
								<p>I offer customized privately-guided tours for you as a couple, family or group of friends, including hotel and lodge accommodation, as well as camping safaris. I travel all over Namibia. Upon request, I also travel to the Okavango-Delta in Botswana, Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe and South Africa. As an absolute Namibia insider, I know the most beautiful and interesting places in the country.</p>
								<p>From consultation to planning, booking and the tour itself, I personally take care.</p>

								<p>If you are looking for an incredible experience, you should consider a trip to Victoria Falls. To combine this with a tour with me to the breathtaking Caprivi region, you can take advantage of an open jaw flight. This means that you'll arrive at one airport and depart at another, so you can easily explore everything this fantastic destination has to offer in only two weeks. In this case, you'll arrive in Windhoek and depart from Victoria Falls (e.g. with Ethiopian Airlines or Eurowings Discover).</p>

								<p>Important: these are only examples! Everything will be individually adapted to your preferences. Your vacation should be unique, it should fit your likes and desires.</p>

								<h4>Vehicles</h4>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>I own a Mahindra double cab 4x4 &ndash; very comfortable, reliable and with plenty of storage space for luggage and camping equipment. My car goes through a "Certificate of Fitness" inspection every year. I drive with tire pressure sensors: there is a signal as soon as the air pressure drops.</p>

								<p>If your group consists of more than 4 people, I rent a vehicle that will accommodate them (like a Volkswagen van for instance). I only work with experienced and extremely reliable car rental companies.</p>
								<hr />

								<h4>Accomodations</h4>
								<p>There is hardly a limit for accommodation prices in Namibia (+/- 200 €/pers/night), so please consider which category you prefer: reasonable or luxurious?</p>
								<p><strong>Premium:</strong> Here I choose the most beautiful accommodations on site, which means that they are usually also the most expensive on site, with luxury and 4-course menus and everything your heart desires, when the price doesn't matter so much. There is always a limited supply of rooms in these accommodations. They are often also luxury tented lodges with great location and views.</p> 
								<strong>Best value for money:</strong> Here I choose accommodations with a good price-performance ratio - well kept, clean and good food. Some of them are guest farms, but there are also "bigger" accommodations, if there is no other way. I prefer nevertheless also in this price category accommodations with not so many beds, where possible.</p>

                <p>The sooner you get in touch in with me, the better are the chances that suitable accommodations will be available (note that for July, August and September that must be one year in advance).</p>
                <p>My so-called <strong>"glamping" tours</strong> are relatively new: While camping is an affordable way to enjoy nature and the great outdoors, it can be hard work too! With glamping, on the other hand, it's about staying at accommodations that offer camping feeling, but don't require you build your own tent from scratch. They provide everything on site with all sorts of amenities like electricity and bathrooms!
I started out offering these types of tours because I loved how authentic they felt - exploring nature and Namibia's stunning landscapes in a luxury safari setting. These accommodations are beautifully situated in the middle of nature.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>Camping</h4>
								<p>I have igloo-style tents where you can stand up straight. Everyone gets a bedding-roll that includes a mattress, sleeping bag, pillow (both freshly cleaned) and a towel. Those who prefer to sleep in the open air (in the “million stars hotel”) can use cots. Camping chairs and a table are equally provided.</p>
                <p>I will cook for you (campfire or gas), and I only expect your help in the preparation and camp life. In the really wild places, there is no water or toilets, so I carry enough water for a cat wash and set up a field toilet. I map the routes in a way that we can obtain fresh water every other day.</p>
                <p>Camp life involves an incredible amount of equipment. Therefore, I kindly ask you to limit your personal luggage and pack in soft bags. Suitcases are very bulky and not suitable for a camping trip.</p>
